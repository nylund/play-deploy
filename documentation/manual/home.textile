h1. Play rsync & ssh deployment support

This modules simplifies deployment of Play 1.2.x application instances to Linux servers. Changes are pushed to servers using rsync and can be started, stopped and restarted over SSH.

h2. Usage

Deploy production instance and start it
bc. play deploy:update
play deploy:start

Deploy test instance (uses parameters in application.conf, deploy.test.host=...)
bc. play deploy:update --instance=test


h2. Configuration

Your deployment options can be either in application.conf or supplied on the command line. Command line arguments will override anything defined in application.conf.

The default instance's parameters will always be loaded,

bc. deploy.default.host = ip/server
deploy.default.path = remote path
deploy.default.port = port to start app on
deploy.default.login = ssh login to server
deploy.default.play_path = path to play binary

An instance uses default values for the parameter it doesn't define (login, host, play_path in this case). To setup a test instance on the same host but changing only the port and path yyou define:

bc. deploy.test.port = ...
deploy.test.path = ...

You can add any number of instance and use them with the --instance=INSTANCE command line argument

bc. deploy.INSTANCE.host = ...

Note, you may want to setup SSH keys for even easier deployment.

h2. Commands

play deploy:update
play deploy:start
play deploy:stop
play deploy:restart
